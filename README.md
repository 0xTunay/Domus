This project is an intelligent system for monitoring temperature, pressure, and humidity in rooms  

In each room you can install box with ESP32-C3, a BME280 sensor and an SPI display. The ESP32-C3 will send data from sensor to an MQTT broker, which is implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 for processing and then forwarding it  to a web-site with all logs about the room, the sensor and other releted information.
